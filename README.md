# eesen-transcriber
uses EESEN DNN-based decoding, trained on
the TED-LIUM dataset and the Cantab-TEDLIUM language model from
Cantab Research. In addition it includes an adapted version of
Tanel Alumae's Kaldi Offline Transcriber which accepts most any audio/
video format and produces transcriptions as subtitles, plain text, and more.
As a side effect, LIUM speaker diarization is performed

Right now the VM exists as an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) here.
